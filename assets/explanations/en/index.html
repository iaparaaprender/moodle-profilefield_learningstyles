<h3>The learning styles of Felder and Silverman</h3>

<p>Have you ever wondered why some of your classmates seem to learn better when they see pictures, while others do great listening to explanations? Well, this has a lot to do with their learning styles!</p>

<div class="imagecontent imgquestion"></div>

<p>Learning styles</strong> refer to your individual way of acquiring new knowledge and how you prefer to approach unfamiliar topics. Some people are more visual learners, meaning they prefer to use images and graphics to support their learning. Others are slightly more auditory learners or perhaps readers, that is, they tend to prefer verbal information rather than visual information. There are other styles too. As you discover your learning style, you can adapt your study methods to make the most of your skills and knowledge. For us, knowing your learning style will also allow us to offer you materials and resources that best suit your preferences and tendencies.</p>

<div class="imagecontent imgthink"></div>

<p>It is important to highlight that these <strong>learning styles</strong> are not static or definitive, on the contrary, they are flexible and changing. As a student, you will experience throughout your academic life moments or topics in which you will prefer, for example, to read publications to develop concepts or, instead, watch tutorials that exemplify procedures. Likewise, it is essential to understand that your preferences do not determine your professional choice and, much less, define you as a person. Your skills and competencies are a reflection of various dimensions, efforts and experiences. Therefore, think of these learning styles as a way that you usually choose when you have the possibility of choosing which study materials you feel best with. To that same extent, your learning style does not exempt you from covering the materials that your teacher assigns you, but it does help you in the search for support materials that can expand your understanding.</p>

<p>Although there are various models of Learning Styles, here we present the model by Richard Felder and Linda Silverman, which we consider, in addition to being simple, appropriate for the context of the Logical Reasoning course.</p>

<h4>The 4 dimensions</h4>

<p>For Felder and Silverman, learning is characterized by four dimensions that could be understood as stages during the learning process. These are <strong>Perception</strong>, related to the way in which we prefer to perceive information from the environment, whether through the senses or intuition. The <strong>Input</strong>, which indicates the way in which we capture information, whether visually or verbally (that is, written or spoken words). <strong>Processing</strong>, where we really work with the information in our mind, as we analyze it, reflect on it or put it into action. And finally, Comprehension, which refers to the way we assimilate the processed information, either through organized sequences or by being able to see all the information in a panoramic way.</p>

<div class="imagecontent imgdimension"></div>

<h4>The types of styles according to each dimension</h4>

<p>For Felder and Silverman, there are two types of styles depending on the dimension. This means that the dimensions comprise two types that you can imagine as the extremes of a scale, and where your preferences can tend and balance on one side or the other depending on certain factors. In this regard, you must understand that all styles are present in your learning process, but sometimes we tend to approach information in one way or another.</p>

<div class="imagecontent imgbar"></div>

<p>According to the above, the learning styles according to the dimensions are the following:</p>

<h5>Perception</h5>

<div class="styleswithexplanation">
    <div class="imagecontent imgstyle imgsensing"></div>
    <p><strong>Sensory:</strong> People with a sensory learning style prefer to learn through their senses. They focus their attention on concrete details and observable facts. They tend to learn best through concrete examples, problem solving, and practical applications. This means that they may be people who enjoy activities that involve simulation and play.</p>
</div>
<div class="styleswithexplanation">
    <div class="imagecontent imgstyle imgintuitive"></div>
    <p><strong>Intuitive:</strong> People with an intuitive learning style tend to look for patterns and connections in information. They prefer to understand abstract concepts and theories through analysis or synthesis. They tend to learn better when the information is presented in graphs, figures, tables or reading texts that allow them to reach their own conclusions.</p>
</div>

<h5>Entry</h5>
<div class="styleswithexplanation">
    <div class="imagecontent imgstyle imgvisual"></div>
    <p><strong>Visual:</strong> People with a visual learning style assimilate information best through images, graphs and diagrams. They benefit from seeing visual representations of concepts and data. When they have to do practical exercises, it will be better if they can have ways of visualization.</p>
</div>
<div class="styleswithexplanation">
    <div class="imagecontent imgstyle imgverbal"></div>
    <p><strong>Verbal:</strong> People with a verbal learning style learn primarily through verbal explanations and readings. They like to listen and talk about topics to understand them better. These are people who can enjoy books or articles, or video conferences and podcasts. They might also show a willingness to participate in discussion forums.</p>
</div>

<h5>Processing</h5>
<div class="styleswithexplanation">
    <div class="imagecontent imgstyle imgactive"></div>
    <p><strong>Active:</strong> People with an active learning style learn best when they actively participate in activities or exercises. They prefer to learn by doing and experimenting practically. It is for this reason that experiments and simulations may be some of your favorite activities. They may also show interest in highly interactive resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="styleswithexplanation">
    <div class="imagecontent imgstyle imgreflective"></div>
    <p><strong>Reflective:</strong> People with a reflective learning style prefer to learn through reflection and contemplation. It benefits them to think carefully about information before making decisions. Individual or small group activities are usually your choice. Readings and visual materials may also be your favorite as it allows you to analyze details.</p>
</div>

<h5>Understanding</h5>
<div class="styleswithexplanation">
    <div class="imagecontent imgstyle imgsequential"></div>
    <p><strong>Sequential:</strong> People with a sequential learning style prefer step-by-step and progressive work in their learning. They tend to like to follow a logical structure and learn concepts in order. In that sense, activities that can be developed in steps, such as experiments, may be some of your favorites. They may also prefer video conferences, as they are orderly and structured.</p>
</div>
<div class="styleswithexplanation">
    <div class="imagecontent imgstyle imgglobal"></div>
    <p><strong>Global:</strong> People with a global learning style tend to see the big picture and can jump between ideas and concepts more freely. They prefer to learn more holistically and generally, and enjoy making connections between different topics. If any activity can have an alternative solution, they can perform there more comfortably. Comprehensive images and summaries can be of great help to these people.</p>

<p>Now that you know a little more about learning styles, think about your ways or ways of learning and take the <em>"Felder and Silverman Learning Styles Questionnaire"</em> so that you can visualize some of the your preferences or tendencies.</p>
