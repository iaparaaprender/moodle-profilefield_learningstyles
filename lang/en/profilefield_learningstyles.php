This quiz gives you the opportunity to discover your preferred approaches to assimilating and processing information, whether through observation or listening, reflection or action, analysis or visualization, and in a linear or global manner.</ p>
<p>We invite you to complete the questionnaire taking into account that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can view the questionnaire in three different ways: one that includes the questions textually, another that includes supporting images and another that poses the questions from exemplary experiences.</li>
<li>Each quiz consists of 44 questions, but don\'t worry, they are short and easy to answer. The most important thing is that you reflect on your personal ways of assimilating and processing information, that is, those preferences or tendencies you have when learning a new topic.</li>
<li>Each question has two answer options. You decide which one fits you best, as there are no right or wrong answers. It\'s simply about identifying your learning styles.</li>
<li>It is important to note that this questionnaire will not generate passing or failing results. You will be given a bar graph showing the ways in which, according to the questionnaire, you prefer to learn.</li>
<li>You can take the quiz as many times as you want, remember that your learning style is flexible and changing. Thus, if you become aware that your preferences or tendencies change depending on certain moments or topics, you can take the questionnaire with these new appreciations.</li>
